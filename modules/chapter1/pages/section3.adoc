Depending on the purpose of the connection profile, the file can be saved in one of the following directories:

* `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/`: 
The general location for persistent profiles created by the user that can also be edited. NetworkManager copies them automatically to /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/.

* `/run/NetworkManager/system-connections/`: 
The location for temporary profiles that are automatically removed when you reboot the system.

* `/usr/lib/NetworkManager/system-connections/`: 
The location for pre-deployed immutable profiles. When you edit such a profile using the NetworkManager API, NetworkManager copies this profile to either the persistent or temporary storage.
