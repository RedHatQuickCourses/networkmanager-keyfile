= What happens to the ifcfg-rh files now?

Legacy `ifcfg-` files are still supported and are not deprecated.

If a connection has both a keyfile and an ifcfg- file, the keyfile is used and the ifcfg- file is ignored.

NOTE: A deprecated functionality in RHEL 9 means it is removed in RHEL 10+. If a functionality is meant to be removed in RHEL 9, it needs to be announced as deprecated in RHEL 8.
