= What is the upgrade/compatibility impact of this change?

The biggest effect of this change is that new profiles are now persisted in keyfile format. This changes behavior for the users who expect NetworkManager to write ifcfg-rh files, or who have the scripts or tools that expect that.

What still works is that the existing ifcfg files are loaded after upgrading from RHEL8 to RHEL9. Users who only use the D-Bus API (via one of the client applications like nmcli or the GUI), do not notice the difference.

After upgrading NetworkManager, the ifcfg-rh files are still read, hence no intervention is required by the system administrator.

Also, dropping configuration snippets during package upgrade has its own downsides because new installations behave differently than upgraded systems.
