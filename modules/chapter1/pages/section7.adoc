= Is there any change in the user experience?

NetworkManager now prefers the use of the keyfile format (INI files). This format is more readable to users and has a closer resemblance to how the profile is presented in nmcli.

If you use NetworkManager tools that use the D-Bus API (like nmcli or the GUI), then the used storage plugin and format is usually of no concern to you.
