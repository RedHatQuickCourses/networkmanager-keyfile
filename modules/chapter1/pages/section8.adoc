= Advantages of NetworkManager keyfile

The keyfile format has a better syntax and supports all profile types. The keyfile plugin is the only plugin to support all profiles. Having multiple plugins and file formats is confusing.

The long term goal of NetworkManager is to move away from ifcfg-rh files. It affects existing installations and might require migration of existing configurations.

This change is only a first step and affects how NetworkManager by default persists new profiles to disk.
